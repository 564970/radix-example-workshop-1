# Omnia Radix Workshop 1

## Purpose

The purpose of the workshop is to give a general and hands-on introduction to Radix. We do this by "forking" and example application, get familiar with the application, establish a CI environment locally, move the application into Radix and then establish the full CI/CD DevOps cycle.

## Pre-requiste

- In AD group <>
- Test access to “Radix” <url>
- Account on github.com
- Git installed and working locally against github.com
- Docker running locally
- Local dev. environment
- Node js eco system installed and running
- Working on “Statoil Approved”. If not - know how to handle proxis for both Docker and local dev.
